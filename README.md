  # Super Mario Bros. â€“ C++ OOP Project

## Introduction
This project is a **2D Mario-style platformer game** developed in C++ with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Design Patterns**.  
It is built for educational purposes, inspired by classic titles like **Super Mario Bros. (1985)** and **New Super Mario Bros. (2006)**.

## Objectives
- Apply **OOP principles**: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction.  
- Implement at least **5 design patterns**: Factory, Singleton, Observer, State, Strategy.  
- Create a **playable Mario game** with multiple levels, enemies, power-ups, and sound.

## Features Implemented
- **Player Controls**: Keyboard input (walk, jump, sit, fireball).  
- **Movement & Physics**: Acceleration, friction, collision detection.  
- **Enemies**: Goomba, Koopa, Piranha Plant, Bowser (boss AI).  
- **Power-ups & Items**: Mushroom, Fire Flower, Star, Coins.  
- **Levels**: 3 main levels + 1 custom map.  
- **Cutscenes**: Flagpole, Pipe transition, Kidnap, Princess rescue.  
- **Sound System**: Background music, SFX for jump, coin, enemy kill.  
- **Game State Management**: Menu, Level, Pause, GameOver, Continue.  
- **Multiple Players**: Mario & Luigi with unique abilities.  
- **Bonus Features**: Custom level editor, extra cutscenes.

## OOP & Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern** â†’ EnemyFactory & ItemFactory.  
- **Singleton Pattern** â†’ SoundManager, TextureManager.  
- **Observer Pattern** â†’ Event handling (score, lives, effects).  
- **State Pattern** â†’ GameState stack (Menu, Play, Pause, Cutscene).  
- **Strategy Pattern** â†’ TileBehaviors, AI logic for enemies.

## Sounds & Graphics
- **2D graphics** background & animations.  
- **Music & SFX**:  
  - Coin collection, jumping, power-up, enemy defeat.  
  - Background tracks per level.
